FlatAlias is a bash script that once run, creates an alias for all of the currently installed Flatpak packages installed in your machine. The alias corresponds to the package's name. 

FlatAlias must be run again to add newly installed packages and will refrain from adding any already installed package twice. 

With FlatAlias you need only to run 

Obsidian

Into your terminal to launch flatpak Obsidian, instead of running

flatpak run md.obsidian.Obsidian
